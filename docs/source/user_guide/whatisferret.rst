What is ferret?
***************


**ferret** is Python library for benchmarking interpretability techniques. The library
is deeply integrated with the `transformers`_ library, models, and code.

Concretely, ferret lets you:

-  visualize and compare Transformers-based models output explanations using state-of-the-art XAI methods
-  benchmark explanations with ad-hoc XAI metrics for faithfulness and plausibility 
-  streamline the evaluation on existing XAI corpora
-  work both on text-based data and audio-based data (speech classification tasks)
